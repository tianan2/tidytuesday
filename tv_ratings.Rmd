### Has TV been getting better or worse over time? 

```{r}
library(lubridate)

## aggregating numbers by year
by_year <- tv_ratings %>% 
  group_by(year = 2 * (year(date) %/% 2)) %>% 
  summarize(mean_rating = mean(av_rating), 
            median_rating = median(av_rating),
            mean_season1 = mean(av_rating[seasonNumber == 1]), 
            mean_season = mean(seasonNumber),
            sd_rating = sd(av_rating), 
            observations = n()) 

## Plotting every metric into a single graph by using gather
by_year %>% 
  gather(metric, value, -year, -observations, -mean_season, -sd_rating) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, value, color = metric)) +
  geom_line() 

## Plotting mean_rating for seasonNumber
tv_ratings %>% 
  group_by(year = 5 * (year(date) %/% 5), 
           seasonNumber = ifelse(seasonNumber >= 4, "+4", seasonNumber)) %>%
  summarize(mean_rating = mean(av_rating), 
            observations = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, mean_rating, color = factor(seasonNumber))) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(color = "Season", 
       y = "Average rating in each 5-year period")

tv_ratings %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(factor(year), av_rating)) +
  geom_boxplot() 

```

### Show survival
If season 1 is good, what is the probability that they get season 2?

```{r}
first_three_seasons <- tv_ratings %>% 
  filter(seasonNumber <= 3) %>% 
  group_by(title) %>% 
  mutate(first_date = min(date)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  transmute(title, 
            seasonNumber = str_c("season", seasonNumber, sep = ""), 
            first_date,
            av_rating) %>% 
  distinct(title, seasonNumber, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  spread(seasonNumber, av_rating) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(season1)) %>% 
  filter(first_date <= "2017-01-01")
  
library(broom)

glm(!is.na(season2) ~ season1, data = first_three_seasons) %>% 
  tidy()

  


```

```{r}
tv_ratings %>%
  filter(seasonNumber <= 7) %>% 
  group_by(seasonNumber) %>% 
  summarize(av_rating = mean(av_rating)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = seasonNumber, y = av_rating)) +
  geom_line()

tv_ratings %>% 
  group_by(title) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>% 
  mutate(season_number = row_number()) %>%
